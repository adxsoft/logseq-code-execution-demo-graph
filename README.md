# logseq-code-execution-demo-graph
A logseq graph that demonstrates how to use python and/or javascript code within a logseq graph giving Jupyter like behaviours - includes using logseq API calls to get pages and blocks and run queries.

## Video
 - A full walkthrough of the graph can be found in this video ??????????
